Tuskar UI
=========

**Tuskar UI** is a user interface for
`Tuskar <https://github.com/openstack/tuskar>`__, a management API for
OpenStack deployments. It is a plugin for `OpenStack
Horizon <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Horizon>`__.

High-Level Overview
-------------------

Tuskar UI endeavours to be a stateless UI, relying on Tuskar API calls
as much as possible. We use existing Horizon libraries and components
where possible. If added libraries and components are needed, we will
work with the OpenStack community to push those changes back into Horizon.
